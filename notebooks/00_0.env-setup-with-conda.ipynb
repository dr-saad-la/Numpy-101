    "\n",
    "We will begin by installing the package distribution on Mac OS, Linux, and Windows. Then, we will create a virtual environment using the `conda` (or `mamba`) package manager—steps that are consistent across all platforms—and proceed to install Polars using both `mamba` and `pip`. Additionally, we will cover the installation of the Jupyter Lab IDE (optional). Finally, we will test our environment and the installed libraries to ensure everything is functioning correctly."

    "### Installing Miniforge on macOS\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install Homebrew**: If you haven't installed Homebrew yet, you can do so by running the following command in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "Run the following commands in sequence to ensure that your Homebrew installation is working correctly and up to date:\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   brew doctor\n",
    "   brew update\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install Miniforge**: Miniforge is a minimal installer for the conda package manager, specifically designed to be lightweight and compatible with Apple AMD-64 and Silicon Macs (M1, M2, M3 chips).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install Miniforge using Homebrew with the following command:\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   brew install --cask miniforge\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative: Using the Graphical Installer**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer a more user-friendly approach, you can download the graphical installer for Miniforge directly from the [official Miniforge download page](https://conda-forge.org/download/).\n",
    "\n",
    "After downloading the installer:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open the `.pkg` file and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.\n",
    "- This method provides an easy way to set up Miniforge without using the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Miniforge on Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install Dependencies**: Before installing Miniforge, ensure your system has the necessary dependencies installed. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:\n",
    "  - **For Debian distributions**\n",
    "     ```sh\n",
    "     sudo apt-get update\n",
    "     sudo apt-get install -y curl bzip2\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "  - **For Fedora-based systems**\n",
    "     ```sh\n",
    "     sudo dnf update\n",
    "     sudo dnf install -y curl bzip2\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\t**Install Miniforge**: Miniforge is a minimal conda installer that is compatible with Linux distributions.\n",
    "  - Download and install Miniforge:\n",
    "     ```sh\n",
    "     curl -L -O https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh\n",
    "     bash Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tUsing the Graphical Installer: If you prefer to use the graphical installer of Miniforge, you can download it from the [official Miniforge download page](https://conda-forge.org/download/).\n",
    "\n",
    "After downloading, make the installer executable and run it:\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   chmod +x Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh\n",
    "   ./Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Miniforge on Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install Dependencies**: Before installing Miniforge, ensure that your system has the necessary package managers installed. There are three popular package managers on Windows: `winget`, `choco`, and `scoop`. You can use any of these to install Miniforge.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Using `winget`**:\n",
    "   - If you don't have `winget` installed, you can install it through the Microsoft Store or from [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/releases).\n",
    "   - To install Miniforge using `winget`, run the following command:\n",
    "     ```sh\n",
    "     winget install --id=conda-forge.miniforge\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Using `choco` (Chocolatey)**:\n",
    "   - If you don't have Chocolatey installed, you can install it by running the following command in PowerShell as Administrator:\n",
    "     ```sh\n",
    "     Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Once Chocolatey is installed, you can install Miniforge by running:\n",
    "     ```sh\n",
    "     choco install miniforge\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Using `scoop`**:\n",
    "   - If you don't have `scoop` installed, you can install it by running the following command in PowerShell:\n",
    "     ```sh\n",
    "     Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser\n",
    "     irm get.scoop.sh | iex\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - After installing Scoop, install Miniforge using:\n",
    "     ```sh\n",
    "     scoop install miniforge\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install Miniforge Manually**: If you prefer to download and install Miniforge manually without using a package manager, you can do so as follows:\n",
    "   - Download Miniforge from the [official Miniforge download page](https://conda-forge.org/miniforge/windows).\n",
    "   - Once downloaded, run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Using the Graphical Installer**: If you prefer to use the graphical installer of Miniforge, simply double-click on the downloaded `.exe` file and follow the on-screen instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing the installation, you can start using Miniforge for managing your Python environments on Windows."
